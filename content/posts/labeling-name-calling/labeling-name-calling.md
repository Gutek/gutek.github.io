*Through this text, I'm using simple labelling and name-calling: stupid, idiot. Please feel free to replace it with whatever you find more accurate.*

I have a special relationship with *labelling* and *name-calling*. Maybe this is because I was bullied and name-called a lot during my childhood, and I never had the wit to answer fast enough, which led to even more laughs and jokes about me. My ADHD didn't help; if anything, it made things worse, as labels like idiot and stupid were not only used by my peers but also by teachers and other adults. I know how I felt back in the days when they were name-calling me or trying to find a nickname that would hurt. **I just don't wish anyone else to feel the same.**

My family also didn't use a lot of labelling/name-calling - we do swear, in emotion, probably more than others. However, we do this not to humiliate/abuse someone. We can say harsh words towards others, asking them to do something like *shut up* or *jog on*, but we rarely add to that *you idiot* (or other stronger words).

I'm not saying I'm a saint; I do sometimes use labelling in emotion. For example, today, when a car driver is on the road with a 20 km/h limit, speeding around 50 km/h, and missing my kids by 30 cm... yeap, I call that driver an *idiot* quite a loud, adding few F in the middle. My kids heard it. And when emotions are high, sometimes **it is hard to "stop" yourself**. However, when I was retelling this story to someone, I didn't use *idiot* anymore; I used **irresponsible driving without imagination**. That's not abusing, nor humiliating. It describes situations and actions and how I see them. Also, what will the word *idiot* bring to the conversation? Nothing, maybe a bit (a lot) of negative emotions.

Because I'm not using labels, they stand out more clearly to me when someone else uses them in the conversation. It's like wearing yellow when everyone wears black, especially if someone emphasises it through emotion or a firmer tone. And usually, there is a pattern to it; you can observe it if you are meeting with the same people more often. *This labelling will surface again and again when describing someone*.

A few times in my life, I was fortunate to validate accusations like being an *idiot*. In these situations, the right word was not **idiot**. The correct description would be **unorganised** or **not giving an F about the job**.

Of course, there are labels used at someone - *during the conversation, you call someone X, Y and Z* - to describe someone - *when during the conversation, you bring back a story about someone* - or to describe the action, not the person. However, there is a thin line between them.

If you say someone is an idiot in small talk (or think about this when talking to her), then what you think about that person will influence how you interact with her. Sometimes, it is one-off, but usually, it's not. So if person that was named-called/labaled (in head or conversation) says something good and does his job well, what will be the reaction of the person who used labels? Will that person notice that something was done well, or will this be downplayed as *stupid always have luck*?

How will kids around us understand these labels and then use them against others? For instance, my emotional bursts in traffic situations (yeah, not that extream like Michael Douglas in *Failling Down*) already are replicated by my kids. And each time we have a long conversation that *daddy was wrong and we should not use this sort of words* :) I see this in my kids and in other kids, too. Once, when my kids were playing with others, I heard all the time, **You are stupid** and **You idiot**. When challenged, kids were trying to explain that *his face looked like the face of an idiot* or *he moved like a stupid person would* - what does that even mean? What face is it? What move is it?

Recently, my daughter (D), who has ADHD and ASD, came back home and here is how the conversation went:

- D: Are people with ADHD stupid?
- Me: Why do you ask?
- D: One girl was acting crazy, jumping, moving around, and couldn't sit down in one place; later we learn that she has ADHD
- Me: Ow, cool. You have some friends who have similar superpowers to you. But how does this relate to being stupid?
- D: Then a girl said that people with ADHD are jumping and fooling around because they are brainless, stupid people, and if we do not believe, we can ask her mum

ðŸ¤¦

Not being educated about others or conditions is not an excuse for using this sort of comparison and explanation, at least in my opinion. But this happens, and my kids are facing the same problems as I did when I was young, **and it hurts**. I genuinely do not have a piece of good advice; back in the day, **my "skin" got thicker**, and I started to isolate myself from others, but also others were isolated from me; you know, *brainless ADHD person with emotional bursts that can't be controlled*, nobody wanted to be near me or had fun being with me, except few close friends. This was not good either; we are social animals and need interactions (more or less, but still interactions).

The problem with good advice here is: *how many times can you be called an idiot before you start believing you are?* You can change the environment and move to play somewhere else, but you can't change places all the time, running away from the world.

I'm educating my kids to stand (and react) against bullying (*if you stand and do not react, you are part of it*) and name-calling (don't allow others to call anyone the way they would not like to be called). For instance, my son takes it deeply if someone named called him; however he stands against name-calling others. If his peers start to name-calling other kids, he talks to them, saying: **would you like to be called that? Why?** or **he is not stupid; he just does not know how to play football**.

But that does not help when they are called like this. They try to use the same tactic (*I'm not stupid, I just don't knwo how to multiply yet, I need to learn* - I'm proud we get that far with them) but it does not always work. Hence, their skin is getting thicker through a lot of harsh situations :( But at least I know that they are doing their best not to label or name-call anyone else, as they know how much it can hurt.

I might be a special case, or my family, too. However, whenever I see someone, I'm not labelling her, not bullying, just accepting that person as is. I wasn't like that always. I've changed, so can you.

Think about it. Do you use labels or name-calling in your conversations? Why? What are you trying to pass as the information? Are you using stereotypes to describe some traits? What other words you can use to explain what had happened?

BTW: part of ADHD is to react to things that someone says to you without a filter; it feels like an attack on you personally, not on your actions, but on you. Hence, we might be overtouchy here, I'm just saying.
