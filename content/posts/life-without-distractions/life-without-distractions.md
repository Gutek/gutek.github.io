I'm getting distracted quite easily. Like a funny quote says

> I was trying to buy plane tickets and learnt that elephants can't jump - Unknown

The above quote represents the way my brain works. I can start working on a thing, and then something *small*, almost unnoticeable, will beep, vibrate, pop up, be presented as a *"you might be interested in"*, etc., and I'm gone. Even right now, when I'm writing these words, I got a missed call from +380 country code... and what did I do? I stopped and checked which country it was (Ukraine if you're wondering). I would love to say that I have noticed that minor distractions are working against me, so I decided to remove my distractions, but that would be a lie. I didn't. I knew I had fragile concentration, and when I was finally working or doing something, I was getting irritated and annoyed if something was interrupting me. Whatever that something was and whatever if I had control over it: kids shouting outside, car honking, reverse beeping, phone call, popup, you name it.

However, I was not good at connecting the dots between myself and my surroundings. I can connect dots somewhere else - at work and in social situations etc, but not if the dots were ME and MY reaction/action ;)

So, I have unconsciously started removing distractions before it was fancy - everything to allow me more extended periods of contraction. I didn't know what I was doing until I was diagnosed with ADHD. Thanks to diagnoses, I can now see my actions as a way to **self-improve** my working environment. And I know that they make magic. My actions allowed me to concentrate on work, write over 900 posts, prepare presentations, and spend quality time with my family, wife, etc. They could be better, but they worked for me and might work for you. Or are you already doing these once unconsciously, like me?

Here is my list:
- **No push notifications**. Whatever they are: Slack channel, Teams channel, social, school app, email, on mobile, on the desktop, on a laptop, on a smartwatch, or the pad. If I want to check email, I'm opening an email app; if I want to check if I have a message on Slack, I'm opening a Slack. I've trained myself to check some apps a few times daily. There are tools also that can help us control this even more, like [Freedom](https://freedom.to/), or Focus modes on iPhone. So you can block extensive app checking if needed. I had no issue with it. Turning off notifications was good enough for me.
- **No text correction**. This is important if you write a lot. I tend to dump my thoughts quite fast into the editor, making a lot of typos, etc. Whenever the editor is underlining my word or sentence or is proposing to rewrite my sentence, I get distracted. I can work with corrections later on, but first, I need to dump my brain. Whatever tool you are using, you should be able to do it.
- **Phone Always on Silent Mode**. My phone is fully silent - no beeps, rings, nothing. I have a setting that if someone calls me twice or more, they will get through. Also, I have a separate setting for family members. However, I treat my phone the same way as notifications. It's a brick/payment card that I'm carrying with me, and it only becomes a supercomputer when I ask it for it. 
- **No news, whatever news**. News is written in the format to get our attention - *It's going to be a hard week, and we know the most important reason*, yea, who gives a shit? I've learnt that most of the news is useless and does not provide beneficial information; it's just beneficial for them to have me on the site. I blocked most news sites, and I'm not reading, listening, or even watching the news. This puts me in a situation where I might not know what is going on around me; however, in 95%, nothing happens; in 4%, there is something that might interest and that 1% is what everyone else is talking about, so you will hear it, even if you don't want to. I have my resources that aggregate information that is relevant to me, or at least I think it is :) They come in batches - once weekly - so I can work on them when I want/need to. Daily - no news.
- **Clean desk/working area**. Distractions are everywhere. Having a clean desk helps a lot, but it's not easy to keep it clean forever. Too many different things on the desk lead to distractions: *"Oh, this letter that I should send"*, *"Oh, this document I need to read"*. Generally, a template is *"Oh, **THING** I need to **ACTION**."* Hence, I'm trying to have my desk free from distractions.
- **Not everything is a distraction**. This is important. Our mind likes to jump, and we need something to occupy it with. I tend to always have something that I can fidget with. If I don't, I like to repeat (that's a bit from ASD) fingers snapping from the Sherlock Holmes movie with Robert Downey Jr. (or a different one, but with Robert). I need this to stay focused or to motivate myself to do things.
- **Paper to-do list**. Yes, an old-fashioned paper to-do list is next to my desk. It helps drive my day and also helps me not lose concentration when checking that amazing to-do app on my iPhone: *I need to buy new coffee, but I don't have filters; that tea looks good*.

The best thing about ADHD is that it is out of sight, out of mind. So, if you don't see it, it does not bother you. This applies to everything (including people), and this might be an underlying message for a distraction-free life for ADHD people

> **out of sight, out of our mind** - me, i & myself 

If we can't see things, our minds do not think about them; we work with what we have in front of us. This has some drawbacks, which technology can help with: reminders and to-do lists (manual or digital, whatever works for you).

Does it always work? No, sometimes my phone, even on *Silent Mode*, is facing me and boom, when someone calls, the phone turns on display and grabs my attention. Distractions around us were even made into an "ad" for the new ReMarkable Pro (start [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/gcuoqE3Qumk?si=kQyZ4CFD__B4_iQc&t=515)). Hence, remove, remove, remove and remove until you feel okay with your surroundings, and you can work on things you have promised to do hundreds of times already.

There is at least one positive (?) side effect: the filters I started applying to news and social apps/phones, etc., keep me out of *the social drama*. My friends always joke *Were you born yesterday?*. **Yes**, and **I'm happy**; it makes others laugh and me out of all the drama that is around me, which, in the end, does not add to mine or your life - drama, laugh adds a lot of good feelings :) Who cares that some conference was cancelled because of a lack of diversity in speakers? Who cares that 20 influencers started promoting each other posts to get my clients? Who cares that someone is making his "past" psychological a YT sales funnel? Not me, nor should you. Enjoy your life, not someone else.
