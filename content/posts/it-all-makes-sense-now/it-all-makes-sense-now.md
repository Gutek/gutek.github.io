For years, I struggled to fit in. I could never be on time for meetings, school, or work. Authorities did not exist; whoever was in front of me, whatever power over my situation that person had in school or work, it didn't matter. I publicly disagreed with her, argued, pinpointed logical mistakes in her arguments, or showed that I would do the opposite of whatever she said. Planing? What planning! Everything was done at the last moment, including vacation requests, booking, packing, and even notifying the family that we were going on a trip today. The same applied to work; when asked to plan an execution, oh boy, it was like dragging my body across the concrete - thinking in time and space... ðŸ¤¯.

And that was just a tiny part, the part that I knew I needed to work on. It was visible, and I had a lot of feedback about this (yeah, who are you to give me feedback if you were almost as late as I was). However hard I've tried, I always failed to improve. And each time I failed, I bit myself down: **Why** can't you be on time? **Why** did you decide to do that coffee if your bus is in 5 minutes? **Why** did you not shut up when your boss asked you to? **Why** are you starting preparation for that presentation at 22:00, just less than 12 hours before going on stage? Do you know **why**? Because ***you suck, you are useless, you are stupid, you are lazy, and you like to fuck things up***. *Your teachers told you that everyone did; your coaches, sports team members, bosses, and colleagues did. And what, you thought they were wrong? Haha*.

It was not all. Whenever I became good at something, like **really** good, so good that I could be pretty unique, I shifted. There was nothing interesting in pursuing careers in a domain where I felt like a large fish in a small pond. It was **boring**. So, I was spicing things up and re-branding myself as a different kind of person (from a work/qualification perspective). And I never really understood **why**. Why was I changing? Why can't I do that a bit boring tasks/job but then have my retirement much faster?

For years, I was trying to navigate my paths using tools I had and things I knew. However, I felt that my elephant was the one I couldn't truly control/motivate whatever I did. On a good day, when I was unconsciously self-regulating, I could move forward. On bad days, I was a few steps back. I had lived in this equilibrium for most of my life, but then, family and kids happened. And everything went upside down.

I already knew I needed to run, go to the gym, or do whatever I needed to move. This helps regulate my emotional state and reduce my irritation so people can bear to be around me. It's still the case after so many years. Go a few days without exercising, and you don't want to be around me. What I've started to notice that I also had many other self-regulations that were tangled in my day: music, reading, sitting quietly, and someone that I could talk to (whatever means) that is not part of my job or day life (a friend, someone from community or even a gym partner). It was mainly by coincidence that I found what I was missing and its impact on me. Mostly because when I started to have kids, all of the self-regulations had gone south, and finding out what works and what does not and what I need was a painful and lengthy process. The process would continue if not for one person who noticed during a discussion that I use reading, music, silence, etc, to regulate myself, and she said: *looks like you are trying to self-regulate yourself, and it does not always work. Have you checked yourself for ADHD?*

Now, I never thought about myself as an ADHD person, but if I ask my friends, they will all tell you: *gutek? Sure, you can smell his ADHD from miles away*. They never said that to me until I said I might have it, so you know ;) Nevertheless, I also asked my dad (mom is gone). He only said that looking at my childhood, he would not be in shock if I had one, and he started to bring up stories like my first-grade teacher had a special way of treating me and allowing me to do things that others could not so that I can defuse my anxiety.

I started to read about ADHD to familiarise myself with what it is and what its impact is on the person. The more I read, the more I thought *this was me*; worse, *these are my kids*.

So I decided to check myself, and once I had my diagnosis (at age 41), it all clicked in. I was able to connect all the dots. I found the answer to **why**, which helped me understand myself better. Bitting myself down because I was late is useless; I can try to be on time and do all the tricks I know to be on time, but if I'm late, I'm late. If the meeting is too long, I need to say it and take a break, as my brain is shutting down. And many, many more things started to make sense, and my approach to myself, thanks to diagnoses, had changed to a more positive one.

The best part is that I don't treat ADHD as an illness. It's not: *WHAT THE HECK??? WHY ME???* **No!!!**

It's like: **wow, it all makes sense now**.

For me, it's not a label, and it is not a disease; it just helped to explain that what I observed is accurate, and I'm not going mad that someone had much better control over what he is saying and how he is saying, and that even with practice I might never be like that person. **But that person can't be like me**. And that's the beauty. I know my superpowers and weaknesses, and now I understand where they come from. This allows me to steer my life in the direction that my superpowers can be beneficial, and my weaknesses will not impact me negatively.

It all makes sense now.
