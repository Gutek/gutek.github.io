Hi ðŸ‘‹, 

I'm Jakub Gutkowski, locally and to community and friends known as **gutek**, so feel free to call me that too. I'm happy father of two and a husband to beatufull wife for more than a decade.

In my work life, I'm an independent consultant who works directly with teams on long-running projects. I've worked as a Principal Engineer, Cloud Architect Lead, and Engineering Manager. For the last few years, I've been involved in designing and implementing internal development platforms and SaaS products across different technology stacks. I was also a 16th-time Microsoft MVP till 2024.

And I did it all as a neurodivergent person with diagnosed ADHD, dyslexia, I'm colour blind and probably a few other ***labels*** on which I don't want to spend money to get them confirmed.

When I'm not working, I usually go outside to do various sports activities alone or with the family. Yeah, if I'm not doing this, I can't function. It's my way of dealing with the "boredness" of day-to-day activities.

On this blog I would like to share my **thoughts**, things that are not always connected to some main subject/thread. Like having a technical blog and writing about kids... I needed to find a new space, and this is my take. Hope you will enjoy and you will stay with me for longer than `ctrl+W` :)
